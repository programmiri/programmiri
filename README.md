# Hi, I'm Mirjam 👋

[![My GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=programmiri&count_private=true&theme=dracula&show=reviews&show_icons=true)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)


- I'm a Senior Software Engineer 👩‍💻
- I lean heavily on the Frontend side, JavaScript will always be my first big love - TypeScript is ok, too 😬 
- People have said about me I get too excited about testing, especially unit testing (how can get one TOO excited about testing 🤔)
- I'm an international speaker (and yes, often about testing ^^) and love being part of the tech community ❤️ 

#### 🙋‍♀️ I believe that accessibility is an important part in building an inclusive product and I **strongly** believe we Frontend Engineers should aim to build just that!
