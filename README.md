# Hi, I'm Mirjam 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer and fortune to be working in #OpenSource every day. I lean heavily on the Frontend side, JavaScript will always be my first big love - TypeScript is ok, too 😬 People have said about me I get too excited about testing, especially unit testing (how can get one TOO excited about testing???). 

I'm an international speaker (and yes, often about testing ^^) and love being part of the tech community ❤️ Since social anxiety made it really hard for me to join this community, I came up with the idea of [Conference Buddy](http://conferencebuddy.io/). 

I believe that accessibility is an important part in building an inclusive product and I **strongly** believe we Frontend Engineers should aim to build just that!
