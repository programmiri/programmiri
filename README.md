# Hi, I'm Mirjam 👋

- I'm a Senior Software Engineer and fortune to be working in #OpenSource every day 👩‍💻
- I lean heavily on the Frontend side, JavaScript will always be my first big love - TypeScript is ok, too 😬 
- People have said about me I get too excited about testing, especially unit testing (how can get one TOO excited about testing 🤔)
- I'm an international speaker (and yes, often about testing ^^) and love being part of the tech community ❤️ 
- Because social anxiety made it hard for me to join this community, I came up with the idea of [Conference Buddy](http://conferencebuddy.io/) 🐶

##### 🙋‍♀️ I believe that accessibility is an important part in building an inclusive product and I **strongly** believe we Frontend Engineers should aim to build just that!
